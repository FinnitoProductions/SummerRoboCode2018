# Summer Robot Code 2018
We set out to master the ins and outs of FRC robot code over a single summer based around the POWER UP! game concept. We aimed to learn the essentials of both teleoperated and autonomous functions to best prepare us to assist in robot code next build season. Feel free to follow along with our progress at [1072 GitHub Landing - Projects](harkerrobo.github.io/projects.html).
